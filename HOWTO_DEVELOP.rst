In order to develop plonetheme.barceloneta you need to execute on the root of
the package::

     npm install

After executing these commands you can run grunt to watch for any less changes::

     npm run watch

This will make sure that the many .scss files are compiled to .css on the fly and then served up from the theme.

See rules.xml for the relevant Diazo rules.
